#This is a query I wrote to find the attachment rate of a certain item (socks in this instance) 
#to the all-time sale of another item (shoes in this instance). However, we only wanted to count the socks 
#if the customer had bought shoes from the company. We used email as an indicator of a customer, to find 
#the customers who were buying socks and shoes, and what the percent was of socks sold to these customers 
#versus all time shoe sales. This was after debuting the socks; the idea was to see the percent go up daily.
